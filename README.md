# Computer-Final-Assignement

## Introduction
This is the final project of Computer Architecture course.

The goal of that project is to create a simulator of an ISA architecture with 20 operations from a pseudo-binary file. The choice of the language was free, we choose the C.

Made by : YaÃ«l Tahar and Marc Rougagnou

##How to run the program
To run the program, you have to run the main function in main.c.

If you want to change the file to read (the program to execute), you must go on the line 37 of main.c and change the number in the name of the file. There is 8 programs that we have made to facilitate the first interaction with the code.
